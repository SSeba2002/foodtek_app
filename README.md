## Mobile Team UI Implementation - Foodtek App
The first phase is designing the interfaces for the foodtek app. This was designed and implemented by the mobile team. 
The first phase focuses on UI design only, without linking to a database or backend.
As the mobile team, we designed the *Foodtek app's UI screens* in the first phase based on the *Figma design*. We divided the section screens among ourselves as follows:

### Team Members
- *Saba*
- *Baraa*

### Screen Division

| Section | Saba Screens     | Baraa Screens    |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| 1       | 1, 2, 3          | 4, 5             |
| 2       | 2, 4, 6          | 1, 3, 5          |
| 3       | 2, 3, 6, 7       | 1, 4, 5          |
| 4       | 1, 2, 4          | 3, 5             |
| 5       | 2, 4             | 1, 3             |
| 6       | 1, 2             | 3, 4, 5          |

We organized our work and structured the code using the *MVC principle*, making it easy to maintain and modify.

We held a meeting to divide responsibilities and ensure everyone was aligned and supported in case of any challenges. The UI code was fully implemented, and all screens were properly connected.

> *Note:*  
> We encountered an error when displaying the map. We believe the issue is related to Kotlin, but we are confident that it will be resolved with help from the engineer.
